# RestServices
I made a fair few Rest API's througout the years and I've decided to make many (if not all) of them public with some documentation.
Note that some may be rate limited and I don't quote any uptime guarantees for any of them, but feel absolutely free to use them :) (credit is greatly appriciated if its of importance to your project, helps me grow as well)
